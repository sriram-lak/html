            Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), also known as the domestic dog, are a
            subspecies of the gray wolf. They were domesticated by humans over
            14,000 years ago, even before the development of agriculture.
            Physical characteristics Dogs come in a vast array of sizes, shapes,
            and colors. Despite their diversity in appearance, all healthy dogs
            share the same number of bones, with the exception of the tail. They
            possess powerful jaws with around 42 teeth, designed for consuming
            meat. Dogs have a superior sense of smell and hearing compared to
            humans, but their vision is less acute. Behavior and temperament
            Dogs' behavior has been profoundly shaped by thousands of years of
            living alongside humans. They demonstrate remarkable
            social-cognitive abilities, including understanding and
            communicating with people. Common behaviors include play,
            communication through vocalizations (like barking), body posture,
            and scent marking. Socialization is crucial for puppies, helping
            them develop into friendly and confident adults, according to Best
            Friends Animal Society. Dogs exhibit various behaviors that convey
            their emotional state, including tail wagging, ear position changes,
            yawning, and licking. Health and care Proper dog care involves
            providing a safe and healthy environment, including adequate space
            for movement and play. This also means ensuring constant access to
            fresh water and a nutritious, high-quality diet. Regular veterinary
            care, encompassing check-ups, vaccinations, parasite control, and
            dental care, is vital for preventing disease and ensuring overall
            health. Training and exercise are crucial for a dog's physical and
            mental well-being, according to Plush Paws Products. Interesting
            facts Newfoundland dogs are renowned for their lifeguarding
            abilities, possessing water-resistant coats and webbed feet. A
            Bloodhound's sense of smell is so precise that it can be used as
            evidence in a court of law. Basenji dogs don't bark; instead, they
            yodel, whine, or even scream to communicate. According to Purina US,
            dogs are capable of selfless acts of kindness.

          <img src="" alt="Lion" />
          <p>
            Lions (Panthera leo) are large, powerful cats known for their social
            nature and their reputation as apex predators. They are often called
            the "king of the beasts" and symbolize courage, strength, and
            royalty. Habitat and distribution Lions are primarily found in
            Africa, south of the Sahara Desert, inhabiting grasslands, savannas,
            and open woodlands. There's also a small population of Asiatic lions
            (Panthera leo persica) living in India's Gir Forest National Park.
            Lions have a preference for areas with plenty of prey, shade, cover
            for stalking, and access to water, which is why riverine habitats
            are often popular spots. Social structure Lions are the most social
            of all wild cat species, living in groups called "prides". A typical
            pride consists of related females and their cubs, and one or more
            adult males who defend the territory. Females form the stable social
            unit of the pride, and cubs are often raised communally. Male lions
            are easily identifiable by their impressive manes, which can be a
            sign of age, genetics, and hormones, and can also help intimidate
            rivals and attract mates. Hunting and diet Lions are carnivores,
            with a diet consisting primarily of meat. They mainly hunt
            medium-sized to large ungulates like wildebeest, zebra, and buffalo,
            but will also target smaller prey or scavenge carrion when
            necessary. Lionesses are the primary hunters, often working together
            in groups to stalk and ambush prey. Lions can eat up to 40 kg
            (nearly a quarter of their body weight) in a single meal and may
            rest for several days after a large kill. Conservation status and
            threats Lions are listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, with
            populations in decline. Major threats include habitat loss and
            fragmentation, human-wildlife conflict (when lions prey on
            livestock), poaching, and the illegal wildlife trade. Disease, like
            the canine distemper virus, also poses a risk. Interesting facts
            Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar
            together. Their roar is incredibly powerful and can be heard up to 8
            kilometers away. Lions can run for short bursts at speeds up to 81
            km/h (50 mph). They spend a significant portion of their day
            resting, up to 21 hours. Lion cubs are born with spots that fade as
            they mature.

        <article id="Tiger">
          <h2>Tiger</h2>
          <img src="" alt="Tiger" />
          <p>
            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and an
            iconic apex predator, native to Asia. Known for its powerful
            physique, distinctive orange and black stripes, and fearsome
            strength, the tiger plays a crucial role in maintaining the health
            and vitality of its ecosystems. Habitat and distribution
            Historically, the tiger's range extended throughout much of Asia,
            but today, its populations are fragmented and significantly reduced,
            occupying less than 7% of its historical distribution. Tigers
            inhabit a wide variety of environments, including tropical
            rainforests, grasslands, mangrove swamps, and even snowy coniferous
            forests, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to diverse climates.
            Key tiger habitats are found in: The Indian subcontinent. Mainland
            Southeast Asia. The island of Sumatra. The Russian Far East. Diet
            and hunting Tigers are obligate carnivores, primarily preying on
            large and medium-sized ungulates such as deer, wild boars, and gaur,
            which they ambush to secure their meals. Tigers are strong swimmers
            and may even consume fish and crabs as opportunistic prey,
            especially in areas like the Sundarbans. Their diet is crucial for
            controlling herbivore populations, preventing overgrazing and
            habitat degradation that could negatively impact other species.
            Social behavior and reproduction Tigers are largely solitary
            animals, with the basic social unit consisting of a female and her
            cubs. They maintain individual territories, which are marked and
            defended from others of the same sex, especially females competing
            for resources. Male territories are typically larger and often
            overlap with those of several females. Tiger reproduction can occur
            year-round, depending on the region. After a gestation period of
            about 103 days, females typically give birth to litters of two or
            three cubs. Cubs remain with their mother for approximately two
            years, learning essential survival and hunting skills before
            dispersing to establish their own territories. Threats and
            conservation Tigers face significant threats that have led to their
            classification as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened
            Species. These threats include: Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade:
            Driven by demand for tiger parts in traditional medicine and for
            pelts and teeth as status symbols, illegal hunting poses a
            significant danger to tiger populations. Habitat Loss and
            Fragmentation: Deforestation for agriculture, logging, and human
            settlement has severely reduced and fragmented tiger habitats,
            limiting their hunting and breeding opportunities. Human-Wildlife
            Conflict: As human populations expand into tiger habitats,
            interactions leading to conflicts, such as tigers preying on
            livestock and subsequent retaliatory killings, have increased.
            Climate Change: Rising sea levels threaten the mangrove forests of
            the Sundarbans, a critical habitat for a unique tiger population.
            Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas
            like tiger reserves, anti-poaching patrols, and monitoring programs,
            are underway to safeguard tiger populations and their habitats.
            Organizations like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and IUCN's Cat
            Specialist Group are actively involved in these initiatives. Project
            Tiger in India, for example, has significantly contributed to the
            country's tiger population recovery. International cooperation, as
            exemplified by the TX2 goal to double wild tiger numbers by 2022,
            also plays a crucial role in tiger conservation

          <h2>Elephant</h2>
          <img src="" alt="Elephant" />
          <p>
            Elephants, the largest living land animals, are found in various
            habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.
            They are distinguished by their massive bodies, large ears, and long
            trunks. Elephants are also highly intelligent and social animals
            known for their complex social structures and communication methods.
            Here's a closer look at these fascinating creatures: Species African
            Elephants: Comprise two distinct species: the African Bush Elephant
            (Loxodonta africana) and the African Forest Elephant (Loxodonta
            cyclotis). Asian Elephants: Represent a single species, Elephas
            maximus, with three subspecies: Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan.
            Physical Characteristics Trunk: Their most distinctive feature, a
            highly versatile appendage with around 150,000 muscle units used for
            breathing, smelling, drinking, feeding, and social interactions.
            Tusks: Enlarged incisors that grow continuously throughout their
            lives. Both male and female African elephants have tusks, while
            primarily male Asian elephants possess prominent tusks. Ears: Differ
            in size and shape between species. African elephants have large,
            fan-shaped ears, while Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears.
            The ears help regulate body temperature by releasing excess heat.
            Skin: Thick and wrinkled, providing protection from the sun and
            insects. The wrinkles help retain moisture and keep them cool.
            Behavior and Social Structure Herbivores: Primarily feed on grasses,
            leaves, bark, fruits, and roots, spending a significant portion of
            their day eating. Social Animals: Live in complex matriarchal
            societies, where an older female leads the herd. Communication:
            Utilize a variety of methods including sounds (trumpets and
            low-frequency rumbles), body language, touch, and scent. They can
            also communicate through seismic signals detected through their feet
            and bones. Memory: Possess exceptional memories, which aid in
            navigating their environments and remembering individuals.
            Conservation Status and Threats Endangered: Both African and Asian
            elephants are listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the
            IUCN Red List. Poaching: The illegal ivory trade is a significant
            threat, particularly to African elephants. Habitat Loss and
            Human-Elephant Conflict: Expanding human settlements and
            agricultural development fragment habitats and lead to conflicts
            when elephants raid crops or migrate through populated areas.
            Conservation Efforts Numerous initiatives like the Project Elephant
            in India are underway to protect elephant populations and their
            habitats. These efforts involve anti-poaching measures, habitat
            restoration, and strategies to mitigate human-elephant conflict.
            International agreements such as CITES also play a role in
            regulating the ivory trade and protecting elephants.

        <article id="Fox">
          <h2>Fox</h2>
          <img src="" alt="Fox" />
          <p>
            Foxes are small to medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to the
            dog family, Canidae. They are found on every continent except
            Antarctica, thriving in diverse habitats like forests, grasslands,
            mountains, deserts, and even urban areas. Here's a closer look at
            foxes: Physical characteristics Appearance: Foxes generally resemble
            small-to-medium-sized, bushy-tailed dogs with pointed ears, long
            fur, relatively short legs, and a narrow snout. Size: They can vary
            greatly in size, with the smallest being the fennec fox (weighing
            around 0.7 to 1.6 kg or 1.5 to 3.5 lbs) and the largest being the
            red fox (males weighing between 4.1 and 8.7 kg or 9.0 and 19.2 lbs).
            Coat: Fur color, length, and density differ among species. Colors
            can range from pearly white to black-and-white or black flecked with
            white or grey on the underside. Some foxes adapt their coat color to
            the seasons, like the Arctic fox, which turns white in winter for
            camouflage. Behavior and adaptations Habitat Adaptability: Foxes are
            highly adaptable and thrive in a variety of environments, including
            proximity to human habitation. They often prefer mixed landscapes
            with forests, grasslands, and other land-use types. Diet: Foxes are
            omnivores with opportunistic feeding habits. Their diet includes:
            Small mammals (like mice, voles, and rabbits) Birds and their eggs
            Insects and other invertebrates (especially for urban foxes) Fruits,
            berries, and vegetation Carrion and human food waste (especially in
            urban environments) Hunting: Foxes employ a characteristic pouncing
            technique, crouching to camouflage themselves and then leaping onto
            their prey with their hind legs. They have acute hearing to detect
            prey moving underground or in dense vegetation. Some species, like
            the gray fox, can even climb trees. Social Structure: Unlike some
            other canids, foxes are not always pack animals. They typically live
            in small family groups, though some, like Arctic foxes, can be
            solitary. They communicate through body language (tail and ear
            movements), scent marking, and a variety of vocalizations, including
            barks, whimpers, and wails. Lifespan: The typical lifespan of a fox
            in the wild is 1-3 years, but some can live up to 10 years. Types of
            foxes There are many types of foxes across the globe. Some of the
            notable species include: Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes): The largest and
            most common fox species, widely distributed throughout the Northern
            Hemisphere. Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus): Adapted to extreme cold
            with thick, white fur for camouflage in winter. Fennec Fox (Vulpes
            zerda): The smallest fox, known for its large ears that help
            dissipate heat in desert environments. Gray Fox (Urocyon
            cinereoargenteus): A North and Central American fox recognized for
            its tree-climbing ability. Tibetan Sand Fox (Vulpes ferrilata):
            Found in the high-altitude plains of the Tibetan Plateau. Cultural
            significance Foxes hold a significant place in folklore and
            mythology worldwide, often appearing as figures of cunning,
            trickery, or even as spirits possessing magical powers. In European
            folklore, the fox, particularly Reynard the Fox, is a master of
            deception and cunning. East Asian cultures depict foxes (huli jing,
            kitsune, kumiho) as powerful and mischievous spirits capable of
            shape-shifting. Native American cultures attribute various qualities
            to foxes, from wisdom and benevolence to association with fire.
            Relationship with humans Foxes have adapted to coexist with humans,
            even inhabiting urban areas. However, their opportunistic hunting of
            poultry and small livestock can sometimes lead to them being
            considered pests. Fox attacks on humans are rare.
